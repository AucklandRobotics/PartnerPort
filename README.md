# PartnerPort [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AucklandRobotics/PartnerPort.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AucklandRobotics/PartnerPort)
API for accessing the VEX Robotics Partner Port 
 

Eventually, AURA would like to have a guide and library for using 3rd party hardware / software with the Parner port on VEX Cortex Microcontrollers. As of right now, this Repository is a work in progress.

Building on OSX / Linux:

```bash
cd PartnerPort
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Building on Windows

TBD
